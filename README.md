# Zhou Pengwei

I received my Ph.D. degree in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing from Wuhan University in December 2025, 
under the supervision of [Prof. Jian Yao](https://cvrs.whu.edu.cn/). 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, 
working with [Prof. Bo Du](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2892.htm).
